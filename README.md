# automated_ml
This project is an end-to-end automated machine learning (AutoML) model that streamlines the process of building, evaluating, and visualizing machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks. It is designed to help users with minimal data science expertise quickly go from raw data to a well-performing machine learning model.
